# Bone-Fractured-detection-yolov8
This project aims to detect bone fractures by utilizing the yolov8 framework. The main goal is to accurately predict and highlight the fractured areas of the bone by drawing bounding boxes around them and adding labels. By leveraging the yolov8 model, the objective is to efficiently identify and locate bone fractures.
